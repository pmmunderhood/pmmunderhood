## Why do you need it?

For the same reason as any other public activity:

- Get feedback from the followers on your ideas, get tips
- Meet new people from the industry
- Organize your thoughts on different topics, which can help you in preparations for articles or talks 
- Help someone to become better or not make your mistakes
- Have fun

## What should you prepare for your week?

— Tl;DR. It's better to have a plan in advance. You don't have to prepare everything, but a list of topics you want to discuss might be enough. 
Ideally, you should have a list of topics for a week and publish it on your first day.

## What are the most popular topics that you can cover?

You can talk about anything you want related to Product Marketing. You can check what did other authors talk about. Check the first tweet of each author with their plan for a week.
