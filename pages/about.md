Shared Twitter is a platform where different people from the industry share their personal experiences. The concept is simple - every week, 
the account has **a new author** who reveals a new topic every day through a series of tweets and conversations with the followers.
A shared account lets you exchange knowledge with industry experts and learn new things about industry insights. There is no commercial interest behind the account, it’s just great to read about other people's experiences and share your own. 
It’s similar to "ask-me-anything" on Reddit. 


## What are the benefits?

* Experience: each author is unique and comes with their own experience.
* Broadening the horizons: you’ll discover new trends and meet interesting people.
* The shift of your habits: authors can have work methods that are fundamentally different from yours.
* The authors can easily communicate with the participants.
* Personal brand: as an author, you share your professional expertise with the community.
