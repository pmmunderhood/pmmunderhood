                      <p>Happy Monday everyone! It‚Äôs Anastasia <a href="https://twitter.com/khramushinaa" title="Anastasia">@khramushinaa</a> here and I‚Äôm going to take the account over this week üòà

                      <p>A few words about myself: I‚Äôve been into product marketing for almost 3 years. Before that, I worked as a support engineer in the IT company. That‚Äôs where I gained real technical experience and enhanced my soft skills. This combo came in handy in my PMM role.
                      </p>

                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318144755549818881">10:59</a>
                      <p>Here goes my plan for this week.<br />
Mon: The many hats PMMs wear<br />
Tue: The role of PMMs in product releases<br />
Wed: The importance of effective product positioning and messaging<br />
Thu: Why you can't do everything on your own and what to do about it<br />
Fri: How to deal with toxic people
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318157642662117383">11:50</a>
                      <p>As I see it, there are at least four key pillars of product marketing. The first is research - competitor and industry, consumer and market landscape, win/loss analysis and more. It gives you a clear picture of the market, the customers, and also defines your long-term strategy.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318157934828916736">11:51</a>
                      <p>The second is messaging and positioning. Once you know what to build, or the product is actually ready, it‚Äôs PMM‚Äôs job to decide how to talk about it, articulate its value and train the sales and marketing teams to deliver a consistent and accurate message about the product.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318163839066738690">12:15</a>
                      <p>The third pillar focuses on enabling the sales team to sell more. PMMs develop content assets that are used throughout the buyer journey. They also ensure sales reps know how and when to use that content to deliver great buyer experiences and close more deals.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318166609266180096">12:26</a>
                      <p>Finally, the fourth pillar is all about product launches and product lifecycle management. PMMs are responsible for building go-to-market strategies, creating a buzz around the launch, and analyzing its success with post-launch activities.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318179306821083138">13:16</a>
                      <p>You may think ‚ÄúWow, it‚Äôs a lot!‚Äù Yes, it is. But product marketing looks different for each company or, in my case, each product within a company. Business objectives, culture and the company structure define which pillars to focus on or even add a bunch of new responsibilities.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318195784341426183">14:22</a>
                      <p>For instance, at my last job - Netwrix, I focused on the pillars #2 and #3. The recent company acquisition helped us expand our product functionality as well as customer base. That‚Äôs why, all PMM‚Äôs efforts were put into revising the value of our products and sales team training.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318196100881436675">14:23</a>
                      <p>As for the fourth pillar ‚Äì product launches ‚Äì we did a lot in terms of marketing. But all post-launch activities, like analyzing customer feedback or campaign results (the very thing PMMs are usually responsible for) were delegated to Product Management.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318196712570224646">14:26</a>
                      <p>At my current company, on the contrary, PMMs focus on customer feedback and user onboarding, and don‚Äôt work on sales enablement tasks. Mostly, because the company philosophy is different, and the target audience of developers requires a unique selling approach.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318223723804135426">16:13</a>
                      <p>So even though a PMM is indeed a unicorn that should be able to do everything (and sometimes even more), depending on multiple factors, like the company or product portfolio, they are likely to have a different set of responsibilities and tasks.
                      </p>

                      <p>Which pillar do you currently focus on the most?

                      <p>Today, let‚Äôs talk about the role of PMMs in product releases. Of course, the PMM‚Äôs responsibilities vary based on the company and product, so I just want to share my own experience and a few tips with you. Hope you‚Äôll find something useful for your next release.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318512708346667010">11:21</a>
                      <p>It all starts with a nice long conversation with the product manager responsible for the upcoming release. The agenda: Which functionality do we want to focus most of our marketing efforts on? That‚Äôs where the fun begins.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318513333285326848">11:24</a>
                      <p>Thanks to our genius development team at Netwrix, each release we produce lots of new features and even more product improvements. That‚Äôs why PMs often want to market as many of them as possible, while PMMs only cherry-pick what‚Äôs really important.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318530625373077509">12:32</a>
                      <p>How do you decide what‚Äôs important? The key is understanding of the target audience and the market ‚Äî competitors, trends, size and opportunity ‚Äî and how the product is strategically positioned within your market right now.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318530990172721153">12:34</a>
                      <p>The last release I realized that our new product functionality could be beneficial to two markets ‚Äì data security and IT operations management. But based on our current market position, product concept and sales opportunity, the solution was obvious.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318532176313540608">12:39</a>
                      <p>Netwrix provides a data security platform, so the release should be focused on this story, and all major marketing activities will show how our product helps secure customer data. The ITOPs story is also important but we‚Äôll use a limited set of channels and resources to tell it.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318551866733699073">13:57</a>
                      <p>Before working on the product release assets, it‚Äôs a good idea to write the release positioning ‚Äì an internal ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs New‚Äù document for the marketing team. It helps me ensure that everyone has a central place for the key messaging for the right personas.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318552172540329987">13:58</a>
                      <p>The next step is to actually create all the necessary marketing activities. Instead of chaotically working on each piece of release content, spend some time thinking about which assets you need to prepare, and build your own pre-release check list.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318556185600118784">14:14</a>
                      <p>For example, my check list specifies all marketing activities that I need to create, update or at least communicate to other teams. It includes all website updates, in-product messaging, sales tools, webinars and so much more.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318577223167840263">15:38</a>
                      <p>While working on content creation, make sure to reach out to everyone involved in a release process. For example, I check that the support team has all information and technical means to resolve customer issues, such as possible product update errors.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318577684629303298">15:39</a>
                      <p>The solution engineers should have the latest version of the product installed in their environment, and know what use cases to demo when talking to prospects. The sales reps should be aware which persona is interested in the new functionality and know how to sell it.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1318580187525677062">15:49</a>
                      <p>Ensure that all necessary marketing channels are utilized, and the accurate message is used consistently across them. Don‚Äôt forget that marketing assets should also be translated into regional languages.
                      </p>

                      <p>Not every release will be perfect, but it is a learning experience. The best thing to do when it‚Äôs over is to dig deep into analytics and work with customer feedback. The results will help you see what can be improved in your next release.
                      </p>

                      <p>It‚Äôs Wednesday already! Why not to talk about a good old product positioning. First, let‚Äôs keep the difference between positioning and messaging straight. Positioning is an internal statement about your product ‚Äì the north star for all messaging.

                      <p>At Netwrix, PMMs create product positioning and make sure that the channel, SMM, PR, email marketing and other teams rely on it when creating their own content. This content that is actually served to customers is called messaging.

                      <p>Why do you need it? It gives your marketing and sales teams, and, basically, the entire company a complete understanding of who you have built your product for, what value it brings, and the problems it solves.

                      <p>The primary metrics are the number of product downloads (for new customers) and product updates (for existing customers). They also check actual clicks on the new features, and track whether it's a click-and-forget behavior or customers use new functionality consistently. <a href="https://t.co/NXEhw5GymK" title="https://twitter.com/NatashaKatson/status/1318618142877384707">twitter.com/NatashaKatson/‚Ä¶</a>

                      <p>The effective positioning makes it easier to connect with prospects and demonstrate that your product is the right one. When working on it, I think of four elements.<br />
1‚É£ Target market. You must know where and what the target is. All or everyone is not your audience.
                      </p>

                      <p>2‚É£ Product type. If prospects can't quickly figure out which category, industry or market your product is a part of, they will not spend any time considering it. A few examples of product types are auto parts, laptops, smart TV, you name it.
                      </p>

                      <p>My company provides information security and governance software, a very specific category of the product. Just by reading the first line of the positioning statement, our potential customer already knows the context in which they evaluate.

                      <p>3‚É£ Differentiators. One killer differentiator is ideal. You may not want to provide multiple benefits or features as your differentiators. Though, they can support your main one. The SWAT analysis may come in handy to find them all.
                      </p>

                      <p>4‚É£ Value. It ties your differentiator with the needs of the target market. You need to tell your audience how your product will help them achieve what they want. This understanding should come from your market research and customer feedback.

                      <p>In my case, after interviewing our customers, doing win/loss analysis and competitive research, we figured out one simple truth. Our product is easier to use than others on the market, and it is the easiest way to secure their data.

                      <p>So, what value does our product bring? It makes data security easy. As simple as that.

                      <p>We also made separate positioning statements for different personas because each of them wants to ensure that our product will satisfy their unique needs. How can one message communicate to multiple users or buyers? Obviously, it can‚Äôt.

                      <p>Once you have defined your product positioning, make sure it‚Äôs well communicated across the company. You don‚Äôt want a customer getting confused between what your website states and what the sales reps are pitching.

                      <p>When your positioning becomes the central theme for your website, marketing collaterals and press releases, and your sales team knows how to position your product based on who they talk to, you‚Äôll see the difference in increased sales and customer satisfaction soon üòé

                      <p>Out of curiosity, I googled the skills required to become a PMM. Here is a short list: creativity and problem solving, marketing, research and analytics, strategic and business planning, soft skills and empathy. Isn‚Äôt it a bit too much for one person?

                      <p>Here is a trick ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to be perfect in everything, and you can‚Äôt be. But when the idea of self-made individuals is spoken from every corner, it can be hard to accept the truth ‚Äì you can‚Äôt handle every task on your own and do it flawlessly.

                      <p>I learnt this lesson by making lots of mistakes first: committing to multiple tasks at once, working extra hours and on weekends, doing everything on my own and stressing every time something doesn‚Äôt go according to my plan.

                      <p>After a couple of stressful years, I realized that the backlog is not getting any smaller, to-do lists are only getting longer, and I spend too much time and effort when trying to do everything on my own. How does that happen?

                      <p>We often treat all aspects of the job as equally important. At least, I did. I also tried working on them all simultaneously. Now it seems as a noble idea, but it is neither realistic, nor necessary. The first step in breaking this mindset is prioritizing all tasks ruthlessly.

                      <p>1‚É£ You may want to start with a brainstorming session. List every single task waiting for you, no matter how big or small. The goal is to clear your mind and focus on prioritizing the most important tasks from the things that can wait.

                      <p>2‚É£ Find your must dos. They are either deadline-driven, such as creating a webpage for a special event, or they directly support revenue generation, like a presentation for your potential customers.

                      <p>The second group of tasks support your must dos. The third-priority tasks are more nice-to-have ones but they are not necessary to complete right away.

                      <p>Now I think it‚Äôs actually a sign of strength. Meaning, you are self-aware enough to know when it is time to call in some reinforcements. I remember struggling to generate some custom reports in Salesforce. I spent hours trying to identify the right criteria.

                      <p>There are so many toxic people to watch out for. Let me tell you about two types I am familiar with and share some tactics that helped stay sane when dealing with them.

                      <p>ü§ì Know-it-alls. They always want to prove how smart or knowledgeable they are. They take every opportunity to let their coworkers know they already know something. They are never wrong. You can‚Äôt even imagine a know-it-all to say ‚ÄúSorry, I was wrong.‚Äù
                      </p>

                      <p>Even if they are wrong, know-it-alls will always find ways to make you responsible for their actions. I worked with one know-it-all on a few projects. That person was a bottleneck in every decision, even when the actual project stakeholders were satisfied with the results.
                      </p>

                      <p>I found a way to deal with my know-it-all. It might seem counterintuitive but worked well for me. You need to compliment them on things they are genuinely good at. This disarms them because they feel you are on their side. You can leverage this to make your point
                      </p>

                      <p>You can even make an obvious mistake to make your know-it-all find it. After that, my know-it-all felt back in charge and was sure to know best. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs a permanent solution, but if you have to deal with a know-it-all for some time, this might do the trick.

                      <p>üò• Victims. They try to make you solve their problems through constant complaints. No matter how many times you help, they will always come back with another problem. Unfortunately, I met a few victims during my early career.
                      </p>

                      <p>They truly mastered their role, so I was genuinely sorry to hear their problems ‚Äì whether in their personal or business relationship ‚Äì and always tried to help. But no matter what they did or failed to do ‚Äî it was always someone else‚Äôs fault.
                      </p>

                      <p>I tried to reason with victims in the hope that they will snap out of it as well as tried to move them toward more positive thoughts. But when talking to irrational or toxic people, this simply doesn‚Äôt work.
                      </p>

                      <p>It seemed that they enjoyed complaining and weren‚Äôt ready to work on their problems. Victims don‚Äôt take accountability for anything. My advice ‚Äì listen calmly, but clearly state that you can't help. Because, believe me, their problems never end.

                      <p>There are other types of toxic people, but luckily, I never met them. If you want to know more, I recommend one of the books that helped me deal with toxic people in my life.<br />

                      <p>BTW I don‚Äôt like calling toxic people crazy. I think that‚Äôs probably some creative marketing trick for the sake of a compelling headlineüòâ

                      <p>I guess I was lucky enough these people were not a part of my family or friends. As soon as I realized, I was involved in toxic relationship, it wasn‚Äôt hard to let them go. If you notice similar behavior around yourself, ask yourself if this is worth it.

                      <p>Take a closer look at your relationship to see if you have done more than your fair share of help and emotional support. If you can‚Äôt change the people around you, you can change the people you choose to be around.
