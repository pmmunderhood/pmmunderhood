                      <p>Hey all 👋. My name is Nick Larson and I'm a product marketing manager at <a href="https://twitter.com/bananatag" title="Bananatag">@bananatag</a> (which is merging with <a href="https://twitter.com/StaffbaseHQ" title="Staffbase">@StaffbaseHQ</a>). I'm going to be taking over the account this week to share a bit about my own experience as a product marketer
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460283121786441730">16:26</a>
                      <p>I’ll focus on a different thing each day this week: 1) how I see product marketing, 2) how to become a product marketer, 3) the core competencies I think are important for product marketers, 4) how to gain influence in your org, and 5) a reading list.

                      <p>Let's start with the basics. Everyone defines product marketing a little differently, so here's how I think about it. My favorite one line description is from <a href="https://twitter.com/tgrominsky" title="Tamara Grominsky">@tgrominsky</a>: &quot;Product marketing is the linchpin to sustainable business growth.&quot;  (<a href="https://t.co/Q9iv9XgoRc" title="https://medium.com/product-marketing-alliance/the-power-impact-of-good-product-marketing-18d823528f00">medium.com/product-market…</a>)

                      <p>When positioned correctly, product marketing acts as the connective tissue between marketing, sales, customer success, and product <a href="https://t.co/xWpnkHvnKI">pic.twitter.com/xWpnkHvnKI</a>

                      <p>As a product marketer, you help your organization find product-market-fit. You also empower customer facing teams to market, sell, and support your product in the best way possible <a href="https://t.co/G7jBcXd6J3">pic.twitter.com/G7jBcXd6J3</a>
                        <div class="carousel slide" id="media-1460284857943146496" data-ride="carousel" data-interval="false">
                          <div class="carousel-inner">

                      <p>Typically, product marketing sits under either marketing or product in the org chart. While either may seem to make sense for different reasons, I actually believe it should live entirely on its own. Here’s why 💡
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460285872922771459">16:37</a>
                      <p>If your product marketing team reports to marketing, you’re going to be overly influenced by the marketing team’s priorities. Your OKRs will roll up to the marketing team’s OKRs
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460285874009088004">16:37</a>
                      <p>The same goes for product marketers who report to product or any other department. When one set of stakeholders has such an unbalanced amount of influence, you’re not going to be able to truly be that neutral connective tissue
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460285875166740481">16:37</a>
                      <p>Which brings me to another big take away from <a href="https://twitter.com/tgrominsky" title="Tamara Grominsky">@tgrominsky</a>. At Unbounce, she moved product marketing into its own strategic growth department. As soon as <a href="https://twitter.com/bananatag" title="Bananatag">@bananatag</a> merged with <a href="https://twitter.com/StaffbaseHQ" title="Staffbase">@StaffbaseHQ</a>, I began advocating that we do the same.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460285881856577538">16:37</a>
                      <p>A global product marketing team, focused on ensuring the sustainable growth of the business, reporting to a chief strategy officer. And I'm very proud to say that’s gone from being the dream to how we are structured today <a href="https://t.co/DirDM3EEqM">pic.twitter.com/DirDM3EEqM</a>

                      <p>A lot of people ask what the difference is between a product manager and a product marketing manager.<br />
The simple answer is that a product manager should be focused on the user, while a product marketing manager should be focused on the buyer 💸
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460369016191533061">22:08</a>
                      <p>As a product marketer, you need to understand your buyer better than anyone else in your organization
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460369017303040000">22:08</a>
                      <p>How much product marketing and product management interact is going to partially depend on how much the buyer and user interact. In B2C, they’re probably the same person. In B2B SaaS they might not be, but it obviously depends on your product
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460369018464784384">22:08</a>
                      <p>This is also why I often tell startups they should hire a product marketer as soon as possible.<br />
Yes, product managers are key to helping development teams build great products. But product marketers are key to ensuring those products are going to find market fit
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460369019702104067">22:08</a>
                      <p>Product managers also think in terms of minimum viable products (MVPs): what version of the product will be enough to entice early users to try it out and provide feedback for future development
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460369029693014017">22:08</a>
                      <p>Product marketers (should) think in terms of minimum valuable products (MViP?). The difference is subtle, but important: what’s the minimum we need to provide value to our target market <a href="https://t.co/nWHwjiyZw3">pic.twitter.com/nWHwjiyZw3</a>

                      <p>There have been countless minimum viable products that were interesting enough for power users to give them a try but provided no real value to the market
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="tweet"><a class="tweet__time" href="https://twitter.com/pmmunderhood/status/1460369032587014152">22:08</a>
                      <p>While initial usage might be encouraging, it can also quickly send an organization down the wrong path. Which is why you need a product marketer to help you ensure you're truly providing value to your market with everything you do
                      </p>
                    </div>

                      <p>Also, if anyone comes up with a better acronym for minimum valuable product than MViP, PLEASE let me know 😅

                      <p>To sum it up: product marketing is incredibly powerful when positioned correctly within an organization. And you really can’t hire a product marketer too early

                      <p>Fun fact: I never planned on becoming a product marketer. In fact, I made it all the way through business school without knowing exactly what a product marketer was🤷🏻‍♂️<br />
So today I’m going to talk about that journey and how anyone can become a product marketer

                      <p>Quick background: I started my career as a graphic designer, but quickly found I was interested in moving beyond tactical work into something more strategic. So I went back to school and got a degree in professional communication from <a href="https://twitter.com/RoyalRoads" title="Royal Roads">@RoyalRoads</a>

                      <p>While I was studying communication I realized that while helping businesses communicate was great, I wanted to build the businesses themselves. So, I doubled down on my education and did a masters degree in management from <a href="https://twitter.com/UBCSauderSchool" title="UBC Sauder School">@UBCSauderSchool</a>

                      <p>I got lucky! It turns out an MBA or other general business degree is the perfect foundation to be a product marketer. You’re going to need to understand virtually every area of your company at a high level, and you’re also going to need a strong business acumen <a href="https://t.co/qmKsiamPgQ">pic.twitter.com/qmKsiamPgQ</a>

                      <p>I know business schools are taking a lot of heat lately, and while they might not directly prepare you for a lot of jobs, they can provide you with a really strong starting point for a career in many things. Especially product marketing 💯

                      <p>My first job after business school was as employee number 6 at a startup. The existing team was product focused so they needed someone to come in and focus on marketing and sales

                      <p>An environment like that is an INSANELY good learning experience. I created the brand, built the website, went to tradeshows, and developed a sales pipeline. I highly recommend joining a startup early in your career to give you the flexibility to discover what you’re great at

                      <p>I quickly gravitated toward product marketing. A couple months in, I helped launch our first product, basically a big commercial UAV, at a trade show in Las Vegas. I was on cloud nine <a href="https://t.co/94R56SlQly">pic.twitter.com/94R56SlQly</a>

                      <p>But we didn’t find product market fit, and we needed to pivot. The startup way. We learned a ton from meeting with prospects in Vegas and we used that to inform future product development as we pivoted to selling our high precision positioning system separately from the UAV

                      <p>All of a sudden I was a product marketer, even though that wasn’t my title. I was still the only person in both marketing and sales, so I also did a lot of other things, but my focus was on the go-to-market process and aiding product development 🚀

                      <p>Yes it is. You can no longer build them in the office kitchen or by going for drinks after work. However you can still make time to connect with coworkers- we may all be meeting fatigued, but booking time to catchup and asking about your coworkers lives is still highly underrated <a href="https://t.co/THZeqjLlJE" title="https://twitter.com/NatashaKatson/status/1460686685168148487">twitter.com/NatashaKatson/…</a>

                      <p>If you read my last thread you’ll know I had the advantage of getting a few years of product marketing experience in a startup before that was formally my title. The startup path is a great one and I highly recommend it

                      <p>I also see a lot of people move from more general marketing or product roles into product marketing. I think this is a great career strategy: if the role you want is hard to enter directly, make a list of the adjacent roles that interact with your target role

                      <p>You’ll likely find one that’s easier to obtain or you’re more qualified for, and now you’ve got a starting point. For product marketing this would be roles like marketing coordinator, content writer, that sort of thing

                      <p>In the last year I’ve started to have students ask me how they can become a product marketer right out of school, which is super exciting to me 🧑‍🎓🙌<br />
As I mentioned earlier, I didn’t know product marketing was when I was that age

                      <p>If you’re a student reading this and you want to be a product marketer, my tip for you is to tailor everything you do from now on for product marketing. Declare it in your LinkedIn headline. Invest in the PMMC from the <a href="https://twitter.com/PMMalliance" title="Product Marketing Alliance">@PMMalliance</a>. Go to events

                      <p>The thing NOT to do is try to be a catch all. Don’t apply for an inbound or content role at the same time you apply for a product marketing role with a company. You need to make up for the lack of experience by showing drive and focus <a href="https://t.co/LpBK42k78g">pic.twitter.com/LpBK42k78g</a>

                      <p>Product marketing is storytelling. You need to be able to take everything you know about your product, your organization, and your market and tell one hell of a story. Without the ability to do this, nothing else is going to matter <a href="https://t.co/xTo8x27Cs6">pic.twitter.com/xTo8x27Cs6</a>

                      <p>Product marketing is positioning. You need to identify where your product sits in the market and then make a plan to move it where you need it to be. Great positioning is an art, and should be the basis for your messaging, product development, and everything else you do <a href="https://t.co/qDt9Maulfz">pic.twitter.com/qDt9Maulfz</a>

                      <p>Product marketing is defining buyer personas. You need to understand your buyer better than anyone else in your company. You also need to make sure that information is shared with sales, marketing, and product and that you’re all on the same page <a href="https://t.co/jSGP4ZJcdn">pic.twitter.com/jSGP4ZJcdn</a>

                      <p>Time and time again I see organizations that are building products for one persona and trying to market them to another. If you can’t think of where your clearly defined personas currently live off the top of your head, DROP whatever else you’re doing

                      <p>You need to identify the key adoption, usage, and sales metrics for your product and ensure they are being tracked. Don’t assume this is already happening, you might be in for a surprise

                      <p>KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE. Understand your stakeholders’ goals and pains to find the fastest path that product marketing can create value for them. I have some tips based on what I’ve seen at Bananatag, but it’ll vary for your organization <a href="https://t.co/jUa5EoomrK">pic.twitter.com/jUa5EoomrK</a>

                      <p>Salespeople are your most important stakeholder, in B2B SaaS if you don’t have a killer sales team, nothing else matters. Ask them what works, what doesn’t and what resources they need. We use <a href="https://twitter.com/Gong_io" title="Gong">@Gong_io</a> religiously so that we can also hear for ourselves

                      <p>Find a way to quantify your impact on sales. We do a quarterly sales confidence survey (using <a href="https://twitter.com/CultureAmp" title="Culture Amp">@CultureAmp</a>)  to measure confidence in each area of our product, against major competitors, etc. Having a baseline like this is super helpful

                      <p>Product managers are BUSY. At Bananatag I took go-to-market planning and organization off their plate to free them up to focus more on their teams. This should be a win-win for pretty much any org
